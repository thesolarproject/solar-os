## Deezer account setup in Reach
A Demo Account is included for testers, please configure your own to ensure reliable playback and downloads, please do not submit issues about failed downloads / streams if still using the demo account as a Deezer account will offer a single playback slot to an account at one time.

**Reach** can search, stream, and download from [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com) using your account’s **`arl` session cookie** (the same method used by other Deezer download tools). You need a free or Premium Deezer account and a PC on the **same Wi‑Fi** as the Y1.

### On the Y1 

1. Open **Settings → Deezer**.
2. Select **Set up on PC**. Solar starts a small setup server and shows a URL like `http://192.168.x.x:8080/deezer`.

### On your PC

1. In a browser, open the URL shown on the Y1 (**use the Y1’s IP** — not `localhost`).
2. In another tab, log in at [deezer.com/login](https://www.deezer.com/login) if you are not already signed in.
3. Copy your **`arl` cookie** from the browser:
   - **Chrome:** `F12` → **Application** → **Cookies** → `https://www.deezer.com` → copy the **arl** value (long hex string).
   - **Firefox:** `F12` → **Storage** → **Cookies** → `https://www.deezer.com` → **arl**.
4. On the Solar setup page, paste **arl**, choose **MP3** or **FLAC (Premium)**, and tap **Save & Test**.
5. Wait for **Deezer login verified** before closing the page.

### Back on the Y1

1. Press **Back** to leave the setup screen (confirm **I'm finished** if asked).
2. Try **Get Music** from the home menu, or **Settings → Deezer → Search**, and download or queue a track.

### Notes

- Treat **arl** like a password — only paste it on the setup page on your home network.
- If **arl** is missing in DevTools, refresh deezer.com while logged in, or sign out and back in.
- Some test builds ship with a shared demo account; paste your own **arl** to replace it.
- To switch accounts or quality later: **Settings → Deezer → Set up on PC** again.
- **FLAC** requires Deezer Premium; free accounts should use **MP3**.
